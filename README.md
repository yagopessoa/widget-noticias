# News Widget

A simple web app that fetches daily news, using the [News API](http://newsapi.org). This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Hosted at

### [widget-noticias.netlify.com](https://widget-noticias.netlify.com)

## Environment variable

In order to run the project properly, you need to get an API key to be able to use the [News API](http://newsapi.org). After you got one, create a `.env` file in the root folder of the project and set the key into a variable, like so:

### `REACT_APP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>`

## Available Scripts

After you got your API key set up, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
